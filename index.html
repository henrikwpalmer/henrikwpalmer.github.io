			<h2>COVID Quaranspace</h2>
			<p class="body-text">
				<b>Date:</b> April 2020 <br>
				<b>Medium/Tools: </b> Processing, p5.js, Run Trainer App <br>
				<b>Overview: </b> <i>COVID Quaranspace</i> is designed as a way for users to use geolocation to develop form and 
				reflect on their daily life patters. Intially created as an application, the project consists of a window for 
				uploading screenshots of running or walking paths recorded on a running tracker which are then manipulated and 
				orbited in black space. <br> <br>
				<b>Code Description: </b>The code employs a Java script library for importing images from the user. The uploaded image 
				is then processed pixel-by-pixel to identify the pixels showing the path taken. All other pixels are made transluscent 
				thereby removing excess noise in the screenshot. The geographic center of the path is calculated and 
				is used as the folcrum for rotating in 3D space. Each uploaded image is assigned a random color based on 
				a predetermined color pallette<br><br>
				<b>Concept: </b><i>COVID Quaranspace</i> was being developed as I was contemplating the emergent powers claimed by 
				the state during what Carl Schmitt deems the "state of emergency." During this period of heightened national anxiety, governments 
				had or claimed license to impose strict social isoloation standards, shortcut data security protections, and fast-track legislation. 
				Of course, chief among these was the lockdown protocols that many of the world's governments were implementing to varying degrees 
				of enforcement in order to "slow the spread." <br><br> 
				The application reflects on the availability of geolocation data and how these data might be used to map infection risk, social 
				interaction, and social isolation. Further iterations would have incorporated connectivity between users such that 
				users could see how their Quaranspace did or did not overlap with others in their community. <br><br>

			<h2>Hope Dandelion AR Filter</h2>
			<p class = "body-text">
				<b>Date:</b> May 2020 <br>
				<b>Medium/Tools: </b>SparkAR Studio<br>
				<b>Overview: </b><i>Hope Dandelion</i> is an augmented reality (AR) filter made available on Instagram's filter library  
				that invites users to momentarily inhabit a pre-industrial ecological worldâ€”one in which the American Chestnut 
				tree still flourished. By blowing on the non-native dandelion, users unlock a transformation of their surroundings, 
				exploring a dream-like world of abundant fruits and vegetation.<br><br>
				<b>Experience: </b>The filter opens with the user in selfie view, holding a digital dandelion with the 
				prompt to make a wish. After blowing on the seeds, blossoms begin to floatâ€”first apple and peach blossoms, 
				then chestnutsâ€”evoking a Jennifer Steinkamp-like unreality. Switching to the back camera reveals a fully 
				rendered American Chestnut tree in bloom. Blossoms and chestnuts drift through the augmented space, which can be explored from 
				all angles. <br><br>
				<b>Concept: </b>The project was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic and draws parallels between 
				human and ecological disease. It reflects on the cascading pandemics currently affecting New England forests where I grew upâ€”from the Hemlock 
				Woolly Adelgid to the Emerald Ash Borer and the Dutch Elm Diseaseâ€”and mourns the disappearance of species long snuffed out. 
				The American Chestnut, once central to Applachian life as a source of communal food and economic goods, 
				was decimated by a blight imported via global trade- the same force that amplified its economic value. <br> <br>
				By using a Eurasian dandelion as the symbolic key to unlock this imagined past, <i>Hope Dandelion</i> explores the contradictions inherent 
				to economic prosperity enabled through environmental degradation, themes of collective memory and loss, and interconnectivity in a 
				globalized world. It asks: what does restoration look like when it carries the seeds of further deterioration?

			<h2>Echo Chandelier</h2>
			<p class="body-text">
				<b>Date:</b> December 2019 <br>
				<b>Medium/Tools: </b>3D Printing, Rhino Computer Modeling, LED lights manipulated by electronic wiring <br>
				<b>Description: </b>The Echo Chandelier sits at the intersection of political theory, design, and physics. Seeking to use 
				political theory as a method of informing design, the design and orientation of eight dual megaphones and one quad megaphone 
				represents political echo chambers existing in the same physical and digital space</p>

			<h2>Conjoined Solids</h2>
			<p class="body-text">The goal of this project was to arrange three
				found, wooden blocks using a 3D printer. I further
				defined an objective to connect these volumes
				by placing a vertex of one object, with a surface
				of the next. I therefore positioned the blocks in
				this way and used Rhino modeling software to
				create planar objects that froze this orientation.
				In order to maintain this planar component and
				accent the competing planes in the blocks, I expanded
				the joints with parabolic shapes. The large
				flat surface of the joints made printing more difficult,
				however, in both cases I used the 3D printer
				effectively and got well produced results.</p>
