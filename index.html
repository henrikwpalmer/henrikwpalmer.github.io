			<h2>Quaranspace Sketch</h2>
			<p class="body-text">In this project, I was interested in developing a way to draw and develop form using geolocation data. In this application, 
				originally developed as a processing sketch with a "drop" window for uploading your geolocation data, users upload screenshots of their walk, 
				run, or biking route. The code then performs pixel operations in order to show only the path taken and rotates the resulting shape in 3D space.</p>

			<h2>Conjoined Solids</h2>
			<p class="body-text">The goal of this project was to arrange three
				found, wooden blocks using a 3D printer. I further
				defined an objective to connect these volumes
				by placing a vertex of one object, with a surface
				of the next. I therefore positioned the blocks in
				this way and used Rhino modeling software to
				create planar objects that froze this orientation.
				In order to maintain this planar component and
				accent the competing planes in the blocks, I expanded
				the joints with parabolic shapes. The large
				flat surface of the joints made printing more difficult,
				however, in both cases I used the 3D printer
				effectively and got well produced results.</p>
