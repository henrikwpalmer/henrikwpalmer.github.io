			<h2>COVID Quaranspace</h2>
			<p class="body-text">
				<b>Date:</b> April 2020 <br>
				<b>Medium/Tools: </b> Processing, p5.js, Drop Library, Run Trainer App <br>
				<b>Description: </b> COVID Quaranspace is designed as a way for users to use geolocation to develop form. 
				Intially created as an application, the sketch consists of a window for uploading screenshots of running or walking paths recorded
				on a running tracker. The code performs pixels operations on uploaded screenshots to identify the paths taken 
				while making transluscent excess noise in the screenshot. The geographic center of the loop or form is caluculated and 
				is used as the axis for rotating in 3D space. <br><br>
				At the onset of the pandemic, the piece grapples with confinement that lots of the world was experiencing as lockdown measures
				were being implemented to "slow the spread." Further iterations would have incorporated connectivity between users such that 
				users could see how their Quaranspace did or did not overlap with others in their community.</p>

			<h2>Hope Dandelion AR Filter</h2>
			<p class = "body-text">
				<b>Date:</b> May 2020 <br>
				<b>Medium/Tools: </b>SparkAR Studio<br>
				<b>Description: </b>The Hope Dandelion AR Filter was developed as a way for entering a world prior to the environmental degredation
				brought on by industrialization, that is, a world in which the American Chestnut Tree still blumed in North America. The user finds themself 
				in the font-facing camera view with the instruction to make a wish on a Dandelion. After blowing on the Dandelion, a Laurie 
				Anderson-like world unfolds first with apple and peach blossoms, then with chestnuts floating in augmented reality space. 
				After switching to the back camera, the user finds an American Chestnut tree in blume before them. The tree can be explored on the inside 
				and out as blossoms and chestnuts continue to spawn. Throughout 2020, Hope Dandelion was available for use through Instagram's filter 
				library.<br> <br>
				The project was spurred by the many pandemics that affect not only human life, but also the natural world. In the forests surrouding 
				my childhood home, many blights have begun to deteriorate the hardwood trees-- the Hemlocks affected by the XXX, the Ash trees by the 
				invasive Ash bore, the xxx. Most significant to the natural and human world among the species driven to extinction through species-wide
				illnesses was the Chestnut [[XXX]]. </p>

			<h2>Echo Chandelier</h2>
			<p class="body-text">
				<b>Date:</b> December 2019 <br>
				<b>Medium/Tools: </b>3D Printing, Rhino Computer Modeling, LED lights manipulated by electronic wiring <br>
				<b>Description: </b>The Echo Chandelier sits at the intersection of political theory, design, and physics. Seeking to use 
				political theory as a method of informing design, the design and orientation of eight dual megaphones and one quad megaphone 
				represents political echo chambers existing in the same physical and digital space</p>

			<h2>Conjoined Solids</h2>
			<p class="body-text">The goal of this project was to arrange three
				found, wooden blocks using a 3D printer. I further
				defined an objective to connect these volumes
				by placing a vertex of one object, with a surface
				of the next. I therefore positioned the blocks in
				this way and used Rhino modeling software to
				create planar objects that froze this orientation.
				In order to maintain this planar component and
				accent the competing planes in the blocks, I expanded
				the joints with parabolic shapes. The large
				flat surface of the joints made printing more difficult,
				however, in both cases I used the 3D printer
				effectively and got well produced results.</p>
