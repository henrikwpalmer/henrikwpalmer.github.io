			<h2><b>Spurious Data Sandbox [Potentially adding feature to tool]</b></h2>
			<p class="body-text">
				<b>Date: </b>April 2025 <br>
				<b>Medium/Tools: </b>R, RShiny, Leaflet<br><br>

				<b>Overview: </b>In this digital sandbox, users develop their own hypotheses based on publicly available 
				urban geospatial datasets associated with New York City and check in on their favorite trees with live video feeds. 
				Because virtually all of my professional work is highly 
				confidential, this data sandbox, built independently and using open data, provides an insight into the kind of tools 
				and ways of thinking that are employed as an economic consultant, especially around data visualization, data gathering, 
				and pattern discovery.
				[[<b>Potential planned feature:</b> a side panel with toggle bars allowing users to view regression coefficients and interpret the 
				relationships between visualized data series.]]<br><br>

				<b>Code Description: </b>The codes import and synthesize geospatial temperature data gathered by NASA satellites, tree data maintained by 
				the New York City Parks Department, bike lane data and traffic camera surveillance feeds maintained by the New York City Department 
				of Transportation. The RShiny application developed enables toggling on and off different data layers as well as exploring 
				specific data points by selecting pop ups. Links to camera feeds show live feeds of New York City streets.<br><br>

				<b>Concept: </b>This project was motivated by the exorbitant number of cameras on New York City streets encountered 
				on the path of a protest. The tool explores the connection between data measuring tools and conclusions that 
				can be reached. What can be measured from a satellite in space? What can be determined from traffic cameras? What does 
				an abundance of data obscure from observed reality?<br><br>
				Further iterations may investigate the statistical concept of "spurious correlation." This is refers to when  
				two data series are highly correlated but have no logical real-world connection. Much of economic and other social science 
				research relies on correlational studies (regressions) 
				in order to infer causation. <br><br>
				In economic consulting, regressions are frequently used to estimate the effect of certain behaviors 
				or policies‚Äîfor example, quantifying damages by regressing price on a set of explanatory variables, including a dummy variable 
				representing the conduct in question. The direction and magnitude of this dummy‚Äôs coefficient can become the estimated impact or 
				‚Äúdamage.‚Äù In practice, this means that consulting analyses often focus on finding the right combination of variables to influence 
				this key coefficient. <br><br>
				How might the measurements that we use benefit and reinforce existing power structures? Will we get a better view of a tree?

		  <h2><b>Regulatory Framework for Competition in Two-Sided Digital Platforms </b></h2>
		  <p class="body-text">
			<b>Date: </b>November 2021 <br><br>
			<b>Abstract:</b> This chapter published in the Global Competition Review examines evolving antitrust scrutiny 
			of two-sided and multisided digital platforms (i.e., ridesharing apps, food delivery apps, short-term rental apps 
			or any other digital platform which connects two distinct sets of users in an economic exchange) in the United States in 2021. 
			The article emphasizes how the unique economic characteristics of these types of platforms challenge traditional merger review frameworks. 
			For example, a two-sided platform contains a feedback loop whereby a greater number of users on one side of the platform creates more 
			value to the other set of users and thereby spurs greater usage. Consequently, antitrust regulation on these kinds of companies must consider
			the higher barrier to entry that can exist in these markets. <br><br> 
			The chapter discusses the rising concern over acquisition strategies of dominant tech firms, particularly in light of a Biden 
			administration 2021 Executive Order, and highlights tensions within the FTC regarding the application of existing 
			antitrust tools. It analyzes key platform features such as indirect network effects, pricing asymmetry, and 
			nascent competition, and reviews the implications for market definition, competitive effects, and merger remedies. The 
			authors explore the debate between adapting current tools and developing new methodologies to better evaluate competition 
			in digital markets. <br><br>
			<b>Note: </b>Unlike virtually all work I have performed while employed at the economic consulting firm, Analysis Group, this article is non-confidential. 
			The opinions expressed in the chapter are not mine, and indeed, I would argue against several of the points made. Specifically, 
			regarding the more sanitized view of tech companies' "killer acquisitions." My own version of this chapter would include a discussion 
			of the affect on gig workers that the FTC's guidelines have and would situate these developments into broader struggles 
			around corporate power and democratic control.<br><br>
			The main thrust of my contribution to this article was on research into the developments in tensions within the FTC based on the majority 
			and minority opinions. I was also involved in gathering and organizing sources as well as auditing the full chapter.

			<h2><b>COVID Quaranspace</b></h2>
			<p class="body-text">
				<b>Date:</b> April 2020 <br>
				<b>Medium/Tools: </b> Processing, p5.js, Run Trainer App <br><br>
				<b>Overview: </b> <i>COVID Quaranspace</i> is designed as a way for users to use geolocation to develop form and 
				reflect on their daily life patters. Intially created as an application, the project consists of a window for 
				uploading screenshots of running or walking paths recorded on a running tracker which are then manipulated and 
				orbited in black space. <br> <br>
				<b>Code Description: </b>The code employs a Java script library for importing images from the user. The uploaded image 
				is then processed pixel-by-pixel to identify the pixels showing the path taken. All other pixels are made transluscent 
				thereby removing excess noise in the screenshot. The geographic center of the path is calculated and 
				is used as the folcrum for rotating in 3D space. Each uploaded image is assigned a random color based on 
				a predetermined color pallette<br><br>
				<b>Concept: </b><i>COVID Quaranspace</i> was being developed as I was contemplating the emergent powers claimed by 
				the state during what Carl Schmitt deems the "state of emergency." During this period of heightened national anxiety, governments 
				had or claimed license to impose strict social isoloation standards, shortcut data security protections, and fast-track legislation. 
				Of course, chief among these was the lockdown protocols that many of the world's governments were implementing to varying degrees 
				of enforcement in order to "slow the spread." <br><br> 
				The application reflects on the availability of geolocation data and how these data might be used to map infection risk, social 
				interaction, and social isolation. Further iterations would have incorporated connectivity between users such that 
				users could see how their Quaranspace did or did not overlap with others in their community. <br><br>

			<h2><b>Hope Dandelion AR Filter</b></h2>
			<p class = "body-text">
				<b>Date:</b> May 2020 <br>
				<b>Medium/Tools: </b>SparkAR Studio<br><br>
				<b>Overview: </b><i>Hope Dandelion</i> is an augmented reality (AR) filter made available on Instagram's filter library  
				that invites users to momentarily inhabit a pre-industrial ecological world‚Äîone in which the American Chestnut 
				tree still flourished. By blowing on the non-native dandelion, users unlock a transformation of their surroundings, 
				exploring a dream-like world of abundant fruits and vegetation.<br><br>
				<b>Experience: </b>The filter opens with the user in selfie view, holding a digital dandelion with the 
				prompt to make a wish. After blowing on the seeds, blossoms begin to float‚Äîfirst apple and peach blossoms, 
				then chestnuts‚Äîevoking a Jennifer Steinkamp-like unreality. Switching to the back camera reveals a fully 
				rendered American Chestnut tree in bloom. Blossoms and chestnuts drift through the augmented space, which can be explored from 
				all angles. <br><br>
				<b>Concept: </b>The project was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic and draws parallels between 
				human and ecological disease. It reflects on the cascading pandemics currently affecting New England forests where I grew up‚Äîfrom the Hemlock 
				Woolly Adelgid to the Emerald Ash Borer and the Dutch Elm Disease‚Äîand mourns the disappearance of species long snuffed out. 
				The American Chestnut, once central to Applachian life as a source of communal food and economic goods, 
				was decimated by a blight imported via global trade- the same force that amplified its economic value. <br> <br>
				By using a Eurasian dandelion as the symbolic key to unlock this imagined past, <i>Hope Dandelion</i> explores the contradictions inherent 
				to economic prosperity enabled through environmental degradation, themes of collective memory and loss, and interconnectivity in a 
				globalized world. It asks: what does restoration look like when it carries the seeds of further deterioration?

			<h2><b>Echo Chandelier</b></h2>
			<p class="body-text">
				<b>Date:</b> December 2019 <br>
				<b>Medium/Tools: </b>3D Printing, Rhino Computer Modeling, LED lights manipulated by electronic wiring <br><br>
				<b>Overview: </b>The Echo Chandelier consists of eight dual megaphones 3D printed with semi-translucent filament and one quad megaphone 
				printed with black filament. Internal 3D printed structures house coils of LED lights hard wired such that the horizontal ring of megaphones 
				cannot display the same colors as the vertical ring of megaphones. With a remote, these colors can be changed.<br><br>
				<b>Concept: </b>Seeking to use political theory as a method of informing design, the Echo Chandelier reflects on the widely 
				studied political echo chambers in media and social 
				networks. Distilling social interactions down to their most basic form- waves of sound and light, 
				the chandelier uses light as the medium to represent discourse. The orientation of eight dual megaphones and one quad megaphone 
				are such that while all light passes through the same space, it is only received by those with the same color. That is, while virtually 
				all of us have access to any range of opinion, we seek out media and interaction that supports and strengthens our own thinking.<br><br>
				The resulting artwork is a visually intriguing chandelier to be displayed hanging or set on a table. Further iterations might have 
				incorporated motors for moving or otherwise changing the orientation of the megaphones.
